        Gardening, the laying out and care of a plot of ground devoted partially or wholly to the growing of plants such as flowers, herbs, or vegetables.
Gardening can be considered both as an art, concerned with arranging plants harmoniously in their surroundings, and as a science, encompassing 
the principles and techniques of plant cultivation. Because plants are often grown in conditions markedly different from those of their natural environment, it is necessary 
to apply to their cultivation techniques derived from plant physiology, chemistry, 
and botany, modified by the experience of the planter. The basic principles involved in growing plants are the same in all parts of the world,

      <h2>The Nature of Gardening</h2>
      <p>
        Gardening in its ornamental sense needs a certain level of civilization before it can flourish. Wherever that level has been attained,
in all parts of the world and at all periods, people have made efforts to shape their environment into an attractive display. The instinct and even enthusiasm for gardening thus appear to 
arise from some primitive response to nature, engendering a wish to produce growth and harmony in a creative partnership with it.
It is possible to be merely an admiring spectator of gardens. However, most people who cultivate a domestic plot also derive satisfaction from involvement in the processes of tending plants. 
They find that the necessary attention to the seasonal changes, and to the myriad small “events” in any shrubbery or herbaceous border, improves their understanding and appreciation of gardens in general..

      <h2>Comparison with Farming</h2>
      <p>
        
        Gardening for beauty is likely[original research?] nearly as old as farming for food, 
        however for most of history for the majority of people there was no real distinction 
        since the need for food and other useful products trumped other concerns. Small-scale, 
        subsistence agriculture (called hoe-farming) is largely indistinguishable from gardening. 
        A patch of potatoes grown by a Peruvian peasant or an Irish smallholder for personal use could be described as either a garden or a farm. Gardening for average people evolved as a separate discipline, more concerned with aesthetics, recreation and leisure,[35] under the influence of the pleasure gardens of the wealthy.[36] Meanwhile, farming has evolved (in developed countries) in the direction of commercialization, economics of scale, and monocropping.

        In respect to its food-producing purpose, gardening is distinguished 
        from farming chiefly by scale and intent. Farming occurs on a larger scale, 
        and with the production of salable goods as a major motivation. Gardening happens on a smaller scale,
         primarily for pleasure and to produce goods for the gardener's own family or community. 
         There is some overlap between the terms, particularly in that some moderate-sized vegetable growing concerns, often called market gardening, can fit in either category
